# Code Review Checklist for Weather App API

This checklist ensures the Weather App API meets the assignment requirements for functionality, readability, security, performance, and scalability.

## 1. Code Functionality

- [✔] **API Endpoints**: Are all required endpoints implemented (Current Weather, City Search, Favorites Management)?
- [✔] **Weather Data**: Does the Current Weather endpoint provide temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition based on IP or coordinates?
- [✔] **City Search**: Does the City Search endpoint support fuzzy search and return accurate weather details?
- [✔] **Favorites**: Can users save, list, and retrieve favorite cities with weather summaries using JWT authentication?
- [✔] **External API**: Is the OpenWeatherMap API or WeatherAPI.com integrated correctly with proper JSON parsing?
- [✔] **Encryption**: Are all API responses encrypted and decrypted using 64-bit encryption?

## 2. Code Readability and Structure

- [✔] **Naming**: Are variable, function, and class names descriptive and consistent (e.g., `getWeatherByCoordinates`, `WeatherService`)?
- [✔] **Architecture**: Is MVC or Clean Architecture implemented with clear separation of concerns (e.g., models, controllers, services)?
- [✔] **Comments**: Are complex sections (e.g., encryption logic, caching) commented without over-explaining obvious code?
- [✔] **Formatting**: Does the code follow ESLint and Prettier rules for consistent style?
- [✔] **TypeScript**: If used, are types and interfaces defined properly for better type safety?

## 3. Testing

- [✔] **Unit Tests**: Are unit tests written for services, controllers, and utilities using Jest or Mocha/Chai?
- [✔] **Mocking**: Are external APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) mocked for isolated testing?
- [✔] **Coverage**: Is code coverage ≥85%, with a report generated (e.g., Istanbul or Jest)?
- [✔] **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases tested (e.g., invalid city names, expired JWTs, no internet)?

## 4. Security

- [✔] **Encryption**: Is 64-bit encryption (e.g., DES or a custom implementation) correctly applied to all responses and documented?
- [✔] **JWT**: Is JWT authentication secure (e.g., strong secret, expiration, validation)?
- [✔] **Input Validation**: Are inputs sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, header manipulation)?
- [✔] **HTTPS**: Are security headers
- [✔] **Secrets**: Are API keys and sensitive data stored securely (e.g., in `.env` files, not hardcoded)?

## 5. Performance and Scalability

- [✔] **Caching**: Is Redis or in-memory caching implemented to reduce API call overhead?
- [✔] **Rate Limiting**: Is `express-rate-limit` used to throttle requests?
- [✔] **Load Handling**: Does the load test report (JMeter/k6) confirm the API handles 100k concurrent users?
- [✔] **Clustering**: Is Node.js clustering or PM2/Docker used for horizontal scaling?
- [✔] **Load Balancing**: Is NGINX or AWS ALB implemented for distributing traffic?
- [✔] **Optimization**: Are response times optimized (e.g., minimal database queries, efficient parsing)?

## 6. API Design and Documentation

- [✔] **RESTful**: Are endpoints RESTful (e.g., `GET /weather/current`, `POST /favorites`)?
- [✔] **Swagger/Postman**: Is API documentation complete with endpoints, parameters, and encrypted response examples?
- [✔] **Status Codes**: Are HTTP status codes used appropriately (e.g., 200, 401, 404)?
- [✔] **Error Handling**: Are errors returned with meaningful, non-sensitive messages?

## 7. Version Control and GitHub

- [✔] **Structure**: Is the GitHub repository organized (e.g., `/src`, `/tests`)?
- [✔] **README**: Does the README include setup instructions, prerequisites, and usage examples?
- [✔] **Secrets**: Are no credentials or sensitive data exposed in the repo?

## 8. Maintainability and Clean Code

- [✔] **SOLID**: Does the code follow SOLID principles (e.g., single responsibility, dependency inversion)?
- [✔] **Modularity**: Are components reusable (e.g., separate `WeatherService`, `EncryptionUtil`)?
- [✔] **Dependencies**: Are Node.js dependencies minimal, up-to-date, and justified?
- [✔] **DI**: Is dependency injection used for testability (e.g., injecting `WeatherService` into controllers)?
- [✔] **Logging**: Are Winston or Pino logs implemented for debugging and monitoring?
- [✔] **Shutdown**: Does the app handle graceful shutdowns (e.g., closing Redis connections)?

## 9. Error Handling and Reliability

- [✔] **Exceptions**: Are errors caught and handled gracefully (e.g., try-catch blocks)?
- [✔] **Retries**: Are retry mechanisms implemented for external API failures?
- [✔] **Monitoring**: Are Prometheus and Grafana integrated for health monitoring?
- [✘] **Failover**: (Bonus) Is multi-region failover or high availability addressed?

## 10. Bonus Features (If Applicable)

- [✔] **GraphQL**: Is GraphQL implemented for flexible querying?
- [✔] **WebSocket**: Are real-time updates supported via WebSocket?
- [✘] **Serverless**: Is the app deployable on AWS Lambda or Kubernetes?
- [✔] **CI/CD**: Is a GitHub Actions or GitLab CI pipeline set up? (jest example!)
